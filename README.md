# DSC 106 Final Project: Exploring Global Earthquakes

Welcome to our project repository dedicated to providing comprehensive information about earthquakes worldwide, with a focus on those occurring around the Pacific Ring of Fire.

Our website features an engaging scrollyteller that guides users through the science of earthquakes and showcases their global distribution on an interactive map. You can delve into earthquake data spanning from the 1900s to the present day, using our intuitive map interface to filter and explore earthquakes by magnitude and time period.

Additionally, we offer a detailed demo video that delves into the project's design choices and provides a user guide for navigating the interactive earthquake map.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to any of the authors listed on the website's title page. We hope you enjoy your exploration of this repository!
